Usage
=====

If you know how to say `Hi` in different languages you can translate text to that language:

	bin/hello "Hi bash.origin, you super cool coatrack for my bootstrapping logic"
	bin/hallo "Hi bash.origin, you super cool coatrack for my bootstrapping logic"
	bin/hola "Hi bash.origin, you super cool coatrack for my bootstrapping logic"

The scripts above use Google Translate to convert your input. The language input paramaters for the google API are set by the different *entry point scripts* in the `bin` directory which also pass along your input to a common translate function.


Run
===

	./main
